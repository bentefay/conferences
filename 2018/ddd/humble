Readify Consultant - Poya

Sarcasm
Coldness
Answering questions with rhetorical questions
Arrogance
Not listening, not acknowledging
Gossiping and backbiting
Blanket statements about ability, especially technical ability
"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole"

Opposite of ego is ego:
- Self deprecation vs arrogance
- Taking feedback personally vs giving harsh and personal feedback
- Not contributing vs not listening
- ...

Humility can mean lack of confidence (humility is not the opposite of having ego)

Be careful of being so controlling that you become the bottleneck because everyone feels like they have to consult you
Talk to and about people as if they were there
Don't embellish 

An easy antidote: get to know people
Don't stay in the lens of just work, just code
A simple fix: A gentle reminder that we're all humans; we all make mistakes
Be constructive; be specific; be solution oriented

Set concrete goals:
- Identify at least one positive in every PR
- Code reviews aren't just about picking up problems - they are also about highlighting positives
- Get to know people better

You are not your code.
Admit your mistakes. Create a safe place. Be honest.
PR's are a terrible venue for negative feedback; do it face-to-face
