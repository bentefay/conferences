Cognitive biases don't change (they're human) - often it is more important the things that aren't going to change that the things that are
Learning about cognitive bias is an evergreen skill (its relevant for everything)
Halo effect - initial impression is a filter for future experiences
We favor things that are fun
Behaviour can be interpreted many ways based on your previous biases
For example: you could consider someone stubborn or principled from seeing the same behaviour
A 2-system model of conciousness:
  - system 1 ("unconscious") - automatic, effortless, fast, specialised
    - understand space and gravity, evaluate threats and opportunities. track/model immediate environment, prevent loss (saves our lives)
    - heuristics
    - offers up feelings and impressions to system 2
    - sets, associations and prototypes
    - stories and examples rather than statistics (reconciles ambiguity and causality by removing uncertainty and inventing reasons)
  - system 2 ("self" / "conscious") - deliberate, effortful, slow, general-purpose, lazy
   
 A ball and bat cost $1.10 in total. A bat costs $1 more than a ball. Most people answer $1 because system 2 is lazy.

Confirmation bias - being drawn to evidence supporting your worldview
Sunk cost fallacy - continuing to do something to your own detriment because you've invested time or money
  - be honest, communicate early
Availability heuristic - the easier it is to remember an instance of a thing, the bigger that sets of things must be
  - Shark attacks must be a much bigger problem than asthma attacks
  - Everyone thinks they are the hero of the story ("I did like 50% of the work")
  - We haven't even considered the rare cases (we can't consider what we can't conceive - but once we experience it we then overestimate the likelihood of that thing)
Decoy effect - option A, option B, option B but worse ... system 1 will naturally gravitate to option B because B is more common, and option B but worse is not a choice
Actor observer bias (aka fundamental attribution error)
  - You attribute your failures to context and circumstance
  - You attribute other people's failure to their character
Highsight bias - "I knew it all along" 
  - To give us a consistent view of who we are we edit or redact our memories to be consistent with our current knowledge and beliefs
  - Expect vs teach -> Expert can't remember what it's like NOT to know something
  - I don't know what you mean -> I don't have an opinion either way -> I want option C -> I have always wanted option C (they can't remember what it was like to not have an opinion)
  - Documentation of decision making helps here
Third person effect - We believe we're immune to biases but everyone else is not

Avoiding these biases
 - Look out for system 1 providing simplified answers to system 2 problems
 - SEEK EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVES
 - be aware that life and people are generally more complex than we think
