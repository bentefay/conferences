design === experience

consistency (of design and UX) is key
  - look at existing patterns of usage of colours, fonts, whitespace of existing design
    - contrast of serif and san-serif to distinguish different elements
    - this allows users to subsconciously learn the patterns

think inside the box (use existing design patterns) take user expectations into account
  - be consistent
  - use existing patterns and orders: e.g. header, hero, features grid, testimonial, blog, client testimonials...

know your goal and priorities
  - not everything can be big bright and bold
  - what are you trying to achieve? 
  - emphasise just your goal
  - the visual hierarchy should be clear
    - make it clear where to look

environment matters (make it unconditionally easy to use)
  - form factor / in direct sunlight / indoors / outdoors?
  - consider things like contrast and whitespace
  - layout can make an important difference to readability:
    - alternating layouts
    - use of columns / grids
    - whitespace

feedback is essential (interact with your users)
  - every action needs a reaction
  - make sure the first field has focus
  - hover, focus, progress, success
  - also a branding opportunity

When browsing website: "what makes this website awesome?" - build up a toolbox of design patterns

Rule of thirds - break design into 3rds and put your elements at the meeting points 
If focusing on photos, lets the rest of the colours be more neutral, but still use a palette to flag different types of elements
