Facebook - Development culture: chaotic, random... but it was working. The site stayed up.
When he saw the culture: his instinct was to preserve, enhance, explain
Each team worked very differently. It was organised chaos. There was a pattern.

It's important to know what world you live in:
convex - lots of small experiments that have a very low chance of a big payoff
concave - big investment that has a small payoff, but low chance of failure. In this case you want to reduce the risk of failure and slightly increase the payoff.

The big question: What do you have to lose?

Exploration -> finding growth loops - the more you grow, the more you can grow (decreasing marginal cost)

You have to try a lot of bad ideas before you find a growth loop. Exploration.
What do you have to lose? Make sure you're in a convex world.

The opposition to exploration is indifference - no one cares about your idea

There are (at least) 3 very different periods in the life of a business / project:
Explore - How little work can I do to validate an idea (binary - you either win or lose). 
  Small chance of large payoff. 
  (Convex). 
  Focus on lots of experimenting. 
  Only write tests that help you experiment quicker. 
  Estimate is just guess. Don't do it.
Expand - Economies of risk. 
  * One thing you do will get WAY more traction than anything else.
  It's very obvious when you transition from explore into expand.
  Lots of money. Need to reduce risk. Find the next thing that is going to kill you. 
  ***Large chance of large payoff.*** Small period of time.
Extract - This is where KPIs, testing, ... make more sense. 
  Large chance of small payoff. 
  (Concave) 
  Focus on making little improvements.

You can do extract, expand and explore at the same time, but they need different skillsets, different measurements, ...
At Facebook, projects at different stages were treated differently. (And this went well)

However, at Facebook, performance review is metrics driven ("impact"). You must meet the metric-based goal that you set. This doesn't work great when you're in extract.
At this point, everyone is competing to get in their features to improve their "impact" to keep their job. But all these features are interacting is incredibly complex ways - and this
is leading to terrible problems. They now need to be evaluating quality of decision making, not quality of impact.

Kent Beck uses twitter to explore ideas.
One in 20 of his ideas really trigger a response, even though he has no idea which idea it will be.
He also tests his music in this way on Soundcloud.
The key is to cheaply and quickly experiment with ideas.
