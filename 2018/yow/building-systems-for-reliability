You can build microservices around nouns or verbs
If nouns, all your data about an entity is centralized, but features often span many entities, so an entity service going down affects many features
With microservices baesd on verbs, features are decoupled. They pass entities between them. Each has the view they need of the entity.

NEVER name things are entities.

Name them after business processes.
